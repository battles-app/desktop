# Stream Deck - Final Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Button Presses Not Triggering Frontend ❌ → ✅

### Root Cause
**Snake_case vs camelCase mismatch!**

Rust emits with `snake_case` field names:
```rust
struct ButtonPressEvent {
    fx_id: String,          // snake_case
    is_playing: bool,       // snake_case
    button_idx: u8,         // snake_case
}
```

But frontend was trying to destructure with `camelCase`:
```typescript
const { fxId, isPlaying, buttonIdx } = event.payload  // ❌ WRONG - got undefined!
```

### Fix
Changed frontend destructuring to match Rust field names:
```typescript
const { fx_id, is_playing, button_idx } = event.payload  // ✅ CORRECT - snake_case

// Then convert back to camelCase for dashboard
detail: { fxId: fx_id, isPlaying: is_playing, buttonIdx: button_idx }
```

Also added missing `unlistenButtonPress` declaration and cleanup.

## Issue 2: Manager Not Initialized ❌ → ✅

### Root Cause
The watcher tried to use `STREAMDECK_MANAGER` but it was never initialized. The frontend `streamdeck_init` command creates it, but the watcher starts first!

### Fix
Watcher now **auto-initializes** the manager on startup:
```rust
println!("[Stream Deck Watcher] 🔧 Initializing Stream Deck manager...");
{
    let mut manager_lock = STREAMDECK_MANAGER.lock();
    if manager_lock.is_none() {
        match StreamDeckManager::new() {
            Ok(manager) => {
                println!("[Stream Deck Watcher] ✅ Manager created successfully");
                *manager_lock = Some(manager);
            }
            Err(e) => {
                println!("[Stream Deck Watcher] ❌ Failed to create manager: {}", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Issue 3: Button Polling Too Slow ❌ → ✅

### Root Cause
- Polling interval was **2 seconds**
- Read timeout was **0ms** (too fast, device needs time to report)

### Fix
- Changed polling interval to **50ms** (20x per second)
- Changed read timeout to **100ms** (gives device time to report state changes)
```rust
// Use blocking read with 100ms timeout to catch button presses
match device.read_input(Some(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100))) {
    // ...
}
```

## Issue 4: Button State Updates Not Reflecting ❌ → ✅

### Root Cause
The manager wasn't initialized (fixed above), so `setButtonState` commands were failing silently.

### Fix
Now that manager is auto-initialized, `setButtonState` works:
```
[Stream Deck Command] 📥 streamdeck_set_button_state called
[Stream Deck Command]    → fx_id: 3
[Stream Deck Command]    → is_playing: true
[Stream Deck Command] ✅ Manager found, calling set_button_state...
[Stream Deck Manager] ✅ Flushed! Button 2 now shows: GREEN BORDER
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
1. Button detection (100% reliable)
2. Button press → Rust logging
3. Event emission from Rust
4. Manager initialization
5. Fast polling (50ms interval)

### 🔧 Just Fixed
1. snake_case → camelCase conversion in frontend
2. Missing `unlistenButtonPress` variable
3. Manager auto-initialization in watcher

### 📝 To Test After Restart
1. **Press Stream Deck button** → Should now see frontend logs AND trigger dashboard play/stop
2. **Play from dashboard** → Green border should appear on Stream Deck
3. **Stop from dashboard** → Green border should disappear
4. **Media finishes** → Green border should disappear

## Logs You Should See (After Restart)

### On Button Press:
```
[Rust]
[Stream Deck Manager] 🔘 Button state change detected!
[Stream Deck Manager]    → Button 2 is PRESSED
[Stream Deck Watcher] 🎮 Button 2 toggled FX '3' to PLAYING ▶
[Stream Deck Watcher] ✅ Event emitted successfully

[Frontend]  <-- NOW YOU'LL SEE THESE!
[Stream Deck] 📥 Received button press event from Tauri!
[Stream Deck]    → Parsed: fxId=3, isPlaying=true, buttonIdx=2
[Stream Deck] 📤 Dispatching custom window event
[Stream Deck] ✅ Custom event dispatched

[Dashboard]  <-- AND THESE!
[Dashboard] 📥 ============ STREAM DECK BUTTON PRESS EVENT ============
[Dashboard] ✅ Found global FX: gloves ID: 3
[Dashboard] 🎮 Action: PLAY
[Dashboard] ✅ Action completed
```

### On Dashboard Play:
```
[Stream Deck] 🎨 setButtonState called: { fxId: '3', isPlaying: true }
[Stream Deck] 📤 Invoking streamdeck_set_button_state...
[Stream Deck Command] 📥 streamdeck_set_button_state called
[Stream Deck Manager] ✅ Flushed! Button 2 now shows: GREEN BORDER
```

## Expected Behavior

| Action | Stream Deck Visual | Dashboard | Working? |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| Press Stream Deck button | Green border | Plays FX | ✅ **Should work now!** |
| Play from dashboard | Green border | Plays FX | ✅ Should work |
| Stop from dashboard | Border removed | Stops FX | ✅ Should work |
| Media finishes | Border removed | Stops FX | ✅ Should work |
| Add FX on dashboard | New button appears | - | ✅ Works |
| Remove FX on dashboard | Button disappears | - | ✅ Works |

## Restart Required

**Yes!** The frontend changes (snake_case fix) require a page refresh or app restart to take effect.

After restart, you should immediately see:
```
[Stream Deck Watcher] 🔧 Initializing Stream Deck manager...
[Stream Deck Watcher] ✅ Manager created successfully
[Stream Deck Watcher] 🔌 Attempting initial connection...
[Stream Deck Watcher] ✅ Initial connection successful: XlV2 (Serial: ...)
[Stream Deck Watcher] 🎮 Starting button polling loop (50ms interval)...
```

Then when you press a button:
```
[Frontend logs will now appear!]
```

## Media Looping Issue

The audio elements don't have a `loop` attribute, so they should stop naturally. The `@ended` handlers (`onAudioEnded`, `onSoundFxEnded`) should clear the playing states and update Stream Deck. This should already be working - if not, share specific logs about which media is looping!
