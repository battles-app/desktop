# Black Screen Fix (51 fps but no video)

## What I Just Fixed

Added **diagnostic logging** to identify why you're getting frames (51 fps) but seeing black:

### New Diagnostics

When you start the camera now, you'll see:

```
[GStreamer] üöÄ Pipeline started - streaming!
[GStreamer] ‚úÖ Receiving frames (45000 bytes per frame)  ‚Üê Good size
```

OR if black screen:

```
[GStreamer] üöÄ Pipeline started - streaming!
[GStreamer] ‚úÖ Receiving frames (1200 bytes per frame)   ‚Üê TOO SMALL = BLACK
[GStreamer] ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Receiving very small frames, may be black screen
```

OR if camera not opening:

```
[GStreamer] ‚ö†Ô∏è Pipeline in state Paused, may not produce frames
[GStreamer] ‚ùå Pipeline error: Failed to open camera
```

## Run This Now

```powershell
.\build.ps1 dev
```

Then **start a camera** and **check the console** for the diagnostic messages above.

## What the Diagnostics Tell Us

### Scenario 1: Large Frames (20KB+) but Still Black
**Diagnosis**: Format issue or display problem
**Fix**: Issue might be in frontend display, not backend

### Scenario 2: Tiny Frames (<5KB)
**Diagnosis**: Camera not producing video, just black/empty buffers
**Possible causes**:
- Camera in use by another app
- Wrong camera selected
- Camera privacy settings blocked
- mfvideosrc not compatible with this camera

### Scenario 3: Pipeline in "Paused" State
**Diagnosis**: Pipeline failed to start properly
**Possible causes**:
- mfvideosrc can't access camera
- Format negotiation failed
- Missing camera drivers

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Check Camera Isn't in Use
Close: Zoom, Teams, Skype, Discord (anything using camera)

### Fix 2: Try Different Camera
If you have multiple cameras, try camera 0, 1, 2 etc.

### Fix 3: Check Camera Privacy
Windows Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Allow apps to access camera

### Fix 4: Test Camera Outside App
```powershell
# Test with GStreamer directly
E:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64\bin\gst-launch-1.0.exe mfvideosrc device-index=0 ! autovideosink
```

This should show camera feed in a window. If this doesn't work, the issue is GStreamer/camera drivers, not our code.

## After Running with Diagnostics

**Come back and tell me:**
1. What frame size do you see? (e.g., "45000 bytes" or "1200 bytes")
2. What pipeline state? ("Playing" or "Paused")  
3. Any error messages?

Then I can provide a targeted fix!

## Advanced: Try Alternative Pipeline

If mfvideosrc doesn't work, we can try the older ksvideosrc (works better with some cameras despite deprecation warning).

Let me know what the diagnostics show and I'll fix it properly! üîß
