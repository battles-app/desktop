- Keep GStreamer inputs/decoders/caps unchanged.
- No GStreamer compositor element; use two appsinks (camera, fx) â†’ wgpu compositor.
- Frontend contract unchanged: emit final RGBA bytes to existing canvas event shape.
- Prefer RGBA8 sRGB throughout; keep preview low-latency; avoid unnecessary copies.
- If texture sizes change, reallocate textures; otherwise reuse.
