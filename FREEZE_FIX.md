# 🔧 Freeze Issue Fixed

## The Problem

When changing FPS/quality/rotation settings, the video would show initially but then **freeze** after the system status check.

### Root Cause

**Multiple pipelines running simultaneously!**

From your logs:
```
[Composite] ✅ Frame 390 broadcast to 3 WebSocket client(s)
```

This shows **3 active pipelines** all trying to access the same camera at once!

### What Was Happening

1. User selects camera → Pipeline 1 starts ✅
2. User changes FPS → Pipeline 2 starts (Pipeline 1 still running!) ❌
3. User changes FPS again → Pipeline 3 starts (Pipelines 1 & 2 still running!) ❌❌
4. **All 3 pipelines compete for camera access** → System freezes 🥶

## The Fix

### Backend (Rust)
Added **proper pipeline cleanup** before starting a new one:

```rust
// Before: Just set to Null and continue
if let Some(pipeline) = &self.pipeline {
    let _ = pipeline.set_state(gst::State::Null);
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
}

// After: Wait for pipeline to fully stop
if let Some(pipeline) = &self.pipeline {
    println!("[Composite] ⚠️ Stopping existing pipeline...");
    *self.is_running.write() = false;  // Signal threads to stop
    
    let _ = pipeline.set_state(gst::State::Null);
    
    // WAIT for state change to complete (up to 2 seconds)
    match pipeline.state(Some(gst::ClockTime::from_seconds(2))).1 {
        gst::State::Null => println!("✅ Stopped cleanly"),
        state => println!("⚠️ Still in: {:?}", state),
    }
    
    // Extra wait to ensure camera is released
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(500));
}

self.pipeline = None;  // Clear reference
```

### Frontend (Vue)
Changed settings handlers to **stop before starting**:

```javascript
// Before: Just start new pipeline
const onFpsChange = async () => {
  if (selectedCamera.value) {
    await startComposite()  // ❌ Old pipeline still running!
  }
}

// After: Stop, then start
const onFpsChange = async () => {
  if (selectedCamera.value) {
    await stopComposite()   // ✅ Clean stop first
    await startComposite()  // ✅ Then start fresh
  }
}
```

Applied to:
- `onQualityChange()`
- `onFpsChange()`
- `onRotationChange()`

Also improved `stopComposite()`:
- Closes WebSocket first (stops frame flow)
- Waits 300ms for cleanup
- Better error handling

## Expected Behavior Now

When you change settings, you'll see:

```
[Composite] 🛑 Stopping composite pipeline...
[Composite] Closing WebSocket connection...
[Composite] ✅ Pipeline stopped successfully
[Composite] ⚠️ Stopping existing pipeline before starting new one...
[Composite] ✅ Previous pipeline stopped cleanly
[Composite] Starting composite pipeline: 720x1280 @ 60fps
[Composite] 🎬 FIRST FRAME CAPTURED!
[Composite] ✅ Frame 1 broadcast to 1 WebSocket client(s)  ← Only 1 client now!
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the app** and select your camera
2. **Change FPS** from 30 to 60
   - Should see clean stop/start sequence
   - Video should resume smoothly
   - Console shows "1 WebSocket client" (not 3!)
3. **Change FPS again** from 60 to 30
   - Same clean behavior
4. **Change rotation** 0° → 90° → 180° → 270°
   - Each change should be smooth
   - No freezing
5. **Let it run** - Should stay stable indefinitely

## Performance Impact

- **Startup:** +500ms (waiting for clean stop)
- **Runtime:** None - still 30/60 FPS smooth
- **Memory:** Lower (no duplicate pipelines)
- **Stability:** Much better!

## What To Watch For

### Good Signs ✅
- Only "1 WebSocket client(s)" in logs
- Smooth transitions when changing settings
- Video never freezes
- System status check doesn't cause issues

### Bad Signs ❌
- "2 or more WebSocket client(s)" - multiple pipelines running!
- Video freezes after settings change
- Long delays (>3 seconds) when changing settings

If you see bad signs, **restart the app completely**.

## Why It Froze Before

The freeze happened because:

1. **Camera resource exhaustion** - 3 pipelines fighting for 1 camera
2. **Memory buildup** - Each pipeline consuming ~100KB/frame @ 30 FPS
3. **Thread contention** - Multiple frame capture threads blocking each other
4. **GStreamer internal deadlocks** - State machine confusion from multiple instances

The "System Status Check" (every 10 seconds) was just coincidental timing - it didn't cause the freeze, but revealed it when the system was already overwhelmed.

## Summary

- **Problem:** Multiple pipelines running simultaneously
- **Cause:** Settings changes didn't stop old pipeline before starting new one
- **Fix:** Proper stop → wait → start sequence
- **Result:** Clean, smooth operation with no freezing

Your camera feed should now be **rock solid** when changing settings! 🎉
